# Coding Samples by Yunfeng Wu

This repository contains various coding samples from my academic work, utilizing **Stata**, **R**, and **MATLAB** for different tasks, including data cleaning, statistical analysis, graphing, and geographic data processing.

## Overview

The following files are included in this repository:

- **`code_of_thesis`**: Contains the code for my thesis. I used Stata for data cleaning, regressions, and statistical tests, while R was used for generating graphs.
- **`satellite_image_R`**: Contains R code for processing **.tif** satellite images and calculating the deforestation rate in the Amazon Biome.
- **`Macro_hw_matlab`**: Contains MATLAB code used for my macroeconomics homework.
- **`Metrics_hw_R`**: Contains R code for my metrics homework.

## File Descriptions

### `code_of_thesis`
- **Purpose**: This file contains the code used for data cleaning, statistical regressions, and robust test for my thesis.
- **Tools Used**: 
  - **Stata**: For data preparation, regression analysis, and tests.
  - **R**: For generating visualizations and graphs.

### `satellite_image_R`
- **Purpose**: This file processes **.tif** satellite images and calculates the deforestation rate of the Amazon Biome.
- **Tools Used**: R, for image processing and data analysis.
- **Key Features**: Includes functions for reading, manipulating, and analyzing satellite image data.

### `Macro_hw_matlab`
- **Purpose**: Contains MATLAB code for various macroeconomics homework assignments.
- **Key Features**: Includes simulations, data analysis, and visualization related to macroeconomic models and concepts.

### `Metrics_hw_R`
- **Purpose**: R code for solving exercises related to metrics and econometrics homework.
- **Key Features**: Includes statistical analysis, regression models, and performance metrics.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Follow the instructions in the **`readme.md`** file located in each folder for more detailed guidance on running the code in each respective section.
3. Ensure you have the required software:
   - **Stata** for `code_of_thesis`
   - **R** for `satellite_image_R`, `Metrics_hw_R`, and any R-related tasks
   - **MATLAB** for `Macro_hw_matlab`
