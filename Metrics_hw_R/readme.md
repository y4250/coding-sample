# Metrics Homework Code Overview

This folder contains part of the code for my **Metrics Homework**. The files include various econometric techniques applied to the exercises.

## File Descriptions

### `1.R`
- **Purpose**: Calculates **propensity scores** and estimates the **average treatment effect (ATE)**.
- **Method**: The code implements propensity score matching and ATE estimation methods to analyze treatment effects.

### `ps7.R`
- **Purpose**: Identifies independent variables with non-zero estimated coefficients.
- **Method**: Uses **Lasso**, **Adaptive Lasso**, and **Post-Lasso** methods to select variables and estimate coefficients.

### `q1code.R`
- **Purpose**: Performs a **nonparametric regression**.
- **Method**: Implements both **Local Constant** and **Local Linear** regression techniques to estimate relationships between variables without assuming a specific functional form.

### `q2.R`
- **Purpose**: Conducts a **Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) estimation** of a **CES production function**.
- **Method**: Applies GMM to estimate parameters in the CES production function, which models production with different elasticities of substitution.
