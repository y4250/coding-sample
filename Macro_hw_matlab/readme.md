# Macro Homework Code Overview

This folder contains MATLAB code used for my macroeconomics homework assignments. The code explores various macroeconomic relationships and models, with a focus on data analysis and simulation.

## File Descriptions

### `M2_inflation.m`
- **Purpose**: Analyzes the correlation between **M2 money supply** and the **Consumer Price Index (CPI)**.
- **Method**: Applies the **HP filter** to smooth the data and remove cyclical fluctuations, followed by graphical representations of the correlation.

### `hp_filter.m`
- **Purpose**: Investigates the relationship between **government consumption expenditures** and **gross investment**.
- **Method**: Uses the **HP filter** to decompose the data and analyze the long-term trends in these variables.

### `trend_fluctuation.m`
- **Purpose**: Simulates the growth of an economy subject to various **economic shocks**.
- **Method**: Models the dynamic behavior of the economy under shocks, providing insights into how the economy responds to changes over time.

### `dynare.m`
- **Purpose**: Solves a **nonlinear model** with **forward-looking variables**.
- **Method**: Implements a dynamic model using **Dynare** to analyze the intertemporal choices and expectations in a forward-looking setting. The model equations are defined in the accompanying `dynare.txt` file.
